What is a Union in GraphQL?
A union lets a field return more than one type.

Think of it like this:
Imagine you’re asking:

"Hey server, give me something..."

And the server replies:
"Okay, I might give you a User, or maybe an Error."

That “maybe this or that” is exactly what a union does.

Why Should You Use It?

| Situation                                      | Why Union Helps                                      |
| --------------------------------------------   | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Something can return **different results**  | Like `Search` can return `User`, `Movie`, or `Error` |
| ✅ You want **clean error handling**             So frontend can show proper messages                 |
| ✅ You want to avoid **API crashes**           | Instead of crashing, return a custom error type      |
